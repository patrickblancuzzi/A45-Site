- 👋 Presentations

Hi, I’m @patrickblancuzzi, this repository is created for a school project.

- 🎯 The goal

The goal was to create a landing page on a product of our choice, I chose the Mercedes A45 AMG (2017).

- ✏️ Work Organization

The site is divided into two files, one to manage the body of the site, HTML, and the other to manage the style, the css. In this site there are 7 sections each characterized by different contents.


I hope you like it 😜
